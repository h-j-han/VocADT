Hii haithibitishi tu kuwa baadhi ya dinosaria walikuwa na manyoya, nadharia ambayo tayari imezagaa, bali pia inatoa maelezo ambayo kijumla visukuku haviwezi, kama vile rangi na mpangilio wa pande-tatu.	This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.	This does not prove that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that has already been rejected, but also provides information that in general is impossible, such as color and the arrangement of feathers on the body.
. Wanasayansi wanasema manyoya ya mnyama huyu yalikuwa ya rangi ya kahawia-nyekundu upande wa juu na hafifu au rangi ya karotini upande wa chini.	. Scientists say this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.	. Scientists say the animal's fur was yellow-red on top and white or carrot-colored on the bottom.
Utambuzi huo pia unatoa ufahamu wa mageuko ya manyoya katika ndege.	The find also grants insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.	This study also provides an understanding of the effects of cabin pressure on the human body.
Kwa sababu manyoya ya dinosau hayana chimbuko uliyostawishwa vizuri, inayoitwa rachi, lakini huwa na sifa zingine za manyoya — barbu na barbule — watafiti waligundua rachi labda ni maendeleo ya baadaye ya uvumbuzi kuliko sifa hizi nyingine.	Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but do have other features of feathers — barbs and barbules — the researchers inferred the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development that these other features.	Because the dinosaur's feathers were not well-developed, they were called feathers, but scientists discovered that feathers had other characteristics — feathers and feathers — that feathers were a later development of invention than these other characteristics.
Muundo wa manyoya unaonyesha kwamba hayakutumika katika kupeperuka bali yalitumiwa kudhibiti joto au uonyesho. Watafiti walipendekeza kwamba, ingawa huu ni mkia wa dinosauri mchanga, sampuli inaonyesha manyoya ya utu uzima na si manyoya laini ya ndani ya kifaranga.	The feathers' structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.	The structure of the bone shows that it was not used for running, but rather to regulate heat or breathing. Scientists suggested that, although this is a dinosaur bone, the sample indicates a bone of life and not the bone of the inside of a human.
Watafiti walipendekeza kwamba, hata kama huu ni mkia wa dinosau mdogo, sampuli hiyo inaonyesha manyoya ya ukubwa na si manyoya ya kifaranga mdogo.	The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult plumage and not a chick's down.	Researchers suggested that, even though this is a specimen of a small dinosaur, the size of the specimen is not that of a small dinosaur.

Walipata kuwa Jua lilifanya kazi kwa kanuni msingi sawa na za nyota nyingine: Shuguli za nyota zote kwenye mfumo zilipatikana kuendeshwa na mng'ao wao, mzunguko wao na hakuna jingine.	They found the Sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: The activity of all stars in the system was found to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.	They found that Jupiter worked according to the same basic laws as the other stars: the orbit of all the stars in the system was determined by the mass, rotation, and no other factor.
Mng'ao na mzunguko hutumika pamoja ili kuamua namba ya Rossby ya nyota, ambayo inahusiana na mtiririko wa utegili.	The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.	The Rossby number is used together with the Rossby wave to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the star's rotation.
Jinsi idadi ya Rossby inavyokuwa ndogo, ndivyo nyota zinapungua kuwa wa utendaji kwa kuzingatia mabadiliko ya sumaku.	The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star with respect to magnetic reversals.	The smaller the Rossby number, the more sensitive the star is to changes in the sunspot cycle.
